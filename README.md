I found this article interesting because it is very relevant to what we are learning in class as well as this assignment. I was able to learn about what it means to write an efficient, clean message, and why this is so important. As a student who is just starting to learn git and github, this article helped me gain an understanding of git commit messages, a crucial building block of using git. I am hoping that this article will be helpful to other students as well, which is why I decided to upload it as part of this assignment. 

**Comment (Ana Sofia)**: I found this article to be super interesting because I am also fairly new to git and I did not really know what was the best practice for commit messages. It is crucial for working well in a team and therefore essential for this class.
